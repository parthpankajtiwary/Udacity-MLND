    "\n",
    "**b) What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression is a well behaved as far as the features are linear, or even if some functions are ot linear they can be easily converted to linear features using feature engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression is robust to the noise, and overfitting can be prevented using L1, L2 regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "As Logistic Regression gives out probabilities, and based on the probabilities and the given threshold it decides to which class the instance belongs, so it can be useful in the tasks when we have to rank the instances or want to know how strongly or weakly some instance belongs to which class.\n",

    "Logistic Regression can also be scaled well and used with Big Data, since it is efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression performs well, in cases of binary classifications, and where most of the features are linear, or can be turned into linear features using feature engineering. L1 and L2 regularization can be used to avoid overfitting. \n",

As this is a binary classification problem, I think, logistic regression can serve as a good baseline model, and most probably can perform at par with other models if tuned properly. \n",

    "The support vector machine (SVM) algorithm (Boser et al., 1992; Vapnik, 1998) is a classification algorithm that provides state-of-the-art performance in a wide variety of application domains, including handwriting recognition, object recognition, speaker identification, face detection and text categorization (Cristianini and Shawe-Taylor, 2000). During the past three years, SVMs have been applied very broadly within the field of computational biology, to pattern recognition problems including protein remote homology detection, microarray gene expression analysis, recognition of translation start sites, functional classification of promoter regions, prediction of protein-protein interactions, and peptide identification from mass spectrometry data.

    "Support Vector Machine uses hinge loss function which punishes the classifier for mis-classification, which helps in determining the margins.\n",

    "**c) What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?**\n",

    "Support Vector Machine with a linear kernal is not very different than the logistic regression. \n",
    "\n",
    "Support Vector Machine cannot be trained very efficiently. So, it will not work well on a last training data.\n",

    "**d) What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem that we have at hand currently is a binary classification problem, it has two classes to which the students belong, SVM is a binary classifier, we use SVM after logistic regression because if the training data we have at hand is not linearly separable then we can use SVM with 'rbf' kernal to even train on the non-linear data. One of the major weaknesses of SVM is that it is hard to train over a large training set, but in this problem our training set is not large(about 300 training points), so training a SVM classifier would not be so difficult. \n",

When you know the likes and dislikes of users, and you have one new user and a record of his behaviour, you would want to cluster this user to the other users who had similar likes a dislikes. It can be recommending movies on Netflix, products on amazon, of suggest videos or songs on websites like youtube.\n",

    "**b) What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?**\n",

    "\n",
    "**c) What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?**\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the major weaknesses of k-nearest neighbors model is the kind memory it would require to store all the instances of the data. In the problem we have at hand the dataset is rather small, it only has 300 instances, but if it would have been a large data set, it would require memory of the similar order in order to store the training data.\n",

    "**Answer: Given the performance on training set and test set, and keeping factors like available data, limited resources, cost and performance in mind, from all the three models which have been trained on this dataset, k-nearest neighbors classifier seems to be the best model. In terms of F1 score, k-nearest neignors generalizes well on the test set, when compared to the other models, also one important point to note will be the fact that as we increase the number of traning points from 100 to 300, the F1 score for k-nearest neighbors increases consistently for both the test set and training set, and as there is not a lot of difference in the F1 score of test set and training when compared to Logistic Regression and SVM, which indeed is an indication that out model is not overfitting. The training and prediction time that k-nearest neighbors takes is quite less if compared to the other two models we have trained, also because k-nearest neighbors as it is an instance based learning model, and requires no training what so ever. Also the dataset only consists of around 300 instances, which is a small dataset, so k-nearest neighbors is quite efficient in making predictions.** \n",
    "\n",
    "**The fact that k-nearest neighbors can be trained easily on new data as there is practically no training time required for this algorithm, makes it more suitable for an organisation like school, where most probably every year new data will be available and new model must be trained based on the incoming data, or multiple training iterations be made. K-nearest neigbor can be caliberated to avoid overfitting by choosing the number of neighnors to use in making the prediction.**"

    "**Answer: We have trained a k-nearest neighbors classifier on the dataset we were given. All the training data, with all it's features was fed to the k-nearest neighbors model. As k-nearest model is an instance based learning model, so it doesn't generate a function like other candidate model we were considering like Logistic Regression and SVM, it rather stores all the traning data in the memory. So, in instance based learning the whole traning data becomes the function, to which it has to fit the incoming data points.(https://storage.googleapis.com/supplemental_media/udacityu/5446988865/Instance%20Based%20Learning.pdf) So, when to k-nearest neighbors you feed the data of some new student with all the features (in a romantic relations or not, has internet connection or not, number of failures, absences etc.) for which you don't know whether he is likely to graduate or not. The k-nearest neighbors compares it to the other students from the training data depending upon a similarity metric (d), we can define the number of neighbors (students) which should be voting in order to classify this new student. So, what it actually means is, the students who are most similar in terms of traits(features) to this new student from the training data, will vote based on their classification (they graduated or failed), and the class which dominates in the voting will be assigned to this new student. In case of a tie, there are ways in which the tie can be broken, for example by using weighted voting we can resolve ties, the student who is very similar in traits to the new student will be assigned a higher weight when it come to counting the vote.**"
